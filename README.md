# Earthquake Activity Visualization
In this repository we use United States Geological Survey (USGS) combined with leaflet to produce a visualization seismic activity around the world.
Seismic data is obtained from USGS GeoJson page (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

Please visit https://aalejandroq.github.io/HW17_Leaflet/ to see visualization
